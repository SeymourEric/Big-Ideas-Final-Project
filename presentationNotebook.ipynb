    "Welcome to our presentation on what the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh is. For our approach, we decided to focus on the general quality of living as our metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our inspiration for the metric began with considering what a future-homeowner or resident might consider when deciding where to live. We felt that such an individual would consider many factors, such as access to amenities, crime statistics, and more, which all falls in line with the quality of daily life in that neighborhood. We considered alternative metrics, such as economic growth, but ultimately decided that the general quality of living would be the largest factor for the residents. \n",
    "\n",
    "We hope that this project will not only help us identify the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, but also provide valuable insights into what makes a neighborhood desirable."

    "The metric of general quality of living refers to the overall well-being and livability of a neighborhood. It takes into account various factors that contribute to a high quality of life, and in our case, we focused on access to parks, traffic, and crime rates. Overall, we made our decision based on each neighborhoods ability to provide residents with a comfortable end enjoyable living experience, specifically through these submetrics.\n",

It provides hundreds of parks, listing various variations of their names, acreage, square footage, maintenance responsibility, and even the type of park. The features we utilize are the various park names and square footage. Notably, this dataset is missing neighborhood names. \n",

    "Parks can substantially improve the quality of life in a neighborhood. They offer multiple benefits, such as providing recreational opportunities, enhancing the beauty of the area, and even boosting property values. The access to parks could also have a positive impact on physical and mental health by offering a place to congregate, exercise, and just enjoy the weather. They provide a safe and accessible space for the community.\n",

While I don't have much experience with the majority of them, from my personal experience I believe that North Oakland or Shadyside are the best.\n",

    "Tobias - While I am not from Pittsburgh and thus do not have a favorite neighborhood due to lack of experience with most of them, I think our data-driven result is valid. Both parks and traffic are features I'd highly consider if I was picking a neighborhood, and Beltzhoover's top scores in both of those areas is commendable. With crime, it is worth considering that a nicer neighborhood could produce more crime reports due to factors like more trust in the police force or more valuable property to protect. Additionally, a nicer neighborhood could be a more valuable target for crime. More reports of crime does not necessarily determine the quality of life of a neighborhood. In a more extensive report focused on crime, one should consider other factors such as the type of crime or severity of the crimes."
